# PopMap

Winner of the Best Software Prize at Hoya Hacks 2016.

## Description:
Imagine you were traveling in a foreign country and you wanted to get back to your Airbnb or hotel. When you pull out Google Map, it would show you the most direct route. However, that direct way may not be the most comfortable because you may have to go through a dangerous neighborhood or one with very few people. PopMap, on the contrary, will provide users with a safer/happier/more comfortable direction based on the number of businesses at the moment utilizing the k-means clustering algorithm and data from Google Places API.
